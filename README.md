## Overview

The application is a product inventory management system that utilizes CRUD operations to manage products. It allows users to create, edit, update, and delete products. The application consists of a backend and frontend, and this repository contains the backend structure.

### Installation

To install the project and run it locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CrudProject-Express.git```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

    ```shell
    cd CrudProject-Express```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn. Run either of the following commands:

    ```shell
    npm install```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application using the following command:

    ```shell
    npm start```

The backend server will start running on your local host.

### The Challenge

The goal of the project was to implement a product inventory management system using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. The application utilizes environment variables, and it is designed to be deployed on a platform like Render. Postman was used during the development process to test the different endpoints of the application. 

## My Process

### Built With

The project was built with the following technologies and tools:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Nodemon
- Cors
- @makeitrealcamp/db-mock

### What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained experience in using Express.js to build REST API and implementing CRUD operations. I also learned about environment variables, testing APIs with Postman, and using libraries for simulating databases.

### Continued Development

In future development, I plan to enhance the project by adding additional features, such as authentication and authorization for user access, pagination and filtering options for the product list, and error handling.
